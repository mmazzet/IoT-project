# Project Name: Room heating and temperature control system.
#### Student Name: Marianna Mazzette   Student ID: 20104120

#### Description.

My apartment is equipped with 3 electric radiators. I work from home and I would like to be able to
manage the heating more efficiently and monitor temperature and humidity of the room where I spend most of my day.
The 3 radiators take long time before heating the rooms.
On few occasions, I forgot one of the radiators on throughout the night. I would like to avoid a similar event in the future.

I have a portable convector heater that I want to turn smart with the help of a smart plug.
I would like to control the temperature of the room and be able to turn on the heater automatically if the temperature is below a threshold.
Once the heater is on, I want to turn it off after a specified duration.

The Arduino is responsible of reading the sensor data and making decisions to send commands to the smart plug.
The smart plug will control the power supply to the heater. IFTTT will enable the automation.
ThingSpeak will be used to monitor the parameters over time.

I also want to be able to monitor both temperature and humidity in the room.
It could be useful to also control the activation of the heater remotely, when I am not at home.
