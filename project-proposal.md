# Project Name: Room heating and temperature control system.
#### Student Name: Marianna Mazzette   Student ID: 20104120

#### Description.

My apartment is equipped with 3 electric radiators. I work from home and I would like to be able to
manage the heating more efficiently and monitor temperature and humidity of the room where I spend most of my day.
The 3 radiators take long time before heating the room.
On few occasions, I forgot one of the radiators on throughout the night. I would like to avoid a similar event in the future.

I have a back up convector heater that I want to turn smart with the help of a smart plug.
I would like to control the temperature of the room and be able to turn on the heater automatically if the temperature is below a threshold.
Once the heater is on, I want to turn it off after few minutes.

I also want to be able to monitor both temperature and humidity.
